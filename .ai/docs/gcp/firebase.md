## Rules / Guidelines

- We always try to create resources and cloud services as close to our customer base (Sweden), however to a reasonable pricing (EU centric).
- Try to KISS, don't create overly complex solutions to achieve enterprise-grade levels of security, scalability and so on. At the same time don't compromise all these areas for speed of development either. If not sure please ask for guidance when needed.
- For the time being, we want to operate with running costs of approximately 50 SEK / month. If there are significant cost increases then please consult before taking actions.
