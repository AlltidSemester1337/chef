Overall business guidelines

- Refer to README.md for supported features. In case of changes please update the file.
- This is not a large scale, global application with high enterprise-grade requirements. Instead we aim for speed to deliver new functionality and features, without compromising unless valuable.
- The number of users currently in closed beta is =< 5, with expected roughly 30 min time spent in app per day on average.
- The running costs need to be kept as low as possible under 50-100 SEK per month in current closed beta state unless stated otherwise explicitly.
- Also the visual appeal is very important as this will be used in a reference case for a UX designer portfolio, so prioritize to keep the UI crisp and clean. Always ask explicitly for advice if backend tradeoffs are to consider for frontend optimizations.
- The app is currently only distributed on Android but it's possible we may convert later to IOS, don't make any tradeoffs for this matter but when appropriate have this in mind.
- The customer base is expected to be only in Sweden for now, with target user group age 10 - 90 years, and no bias on culture, religion and race. If in doubt of strategic choices ask for input.
